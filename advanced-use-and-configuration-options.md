# Advanced Use and Configuration Options

## The PodCastle Admin Interface

To manage settings and perform advanced operations, has its own admin interface outside of Core Publisher. Ask whoever set up your PodCastle site for the URL, username and password you'll need to log in. 

### Login Page

The login page for PodCastle's admin interface will always be at `[your server address]/admin`.

PodCastle's admin usernames are usually not email addresses or other things containing special characters, but your password can have any kind of letter, number or symbol.
